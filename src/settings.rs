//! The settings module defines the application configuration. It is based on [config], a layered
//! configuration system for Rust applications (with strong support for 12-factor applications).
//!
//! # Layers
//!
//! The configuration consists of up to four layers. Upper layers overwrite lower layer configurations.
//!
//! ## Layer 1 (Environment variables) \[optional\]
//!
//! The environment variables are the top most layer. They can be used to overwrite any previous configuration.
//! Environment variables have the format `[ENV_PREFIX]__[field]__[sub_field]` where `ENV_PREFIX` is
//! an environment variable defaulting to `XENOS`. That means, the nested settings field `cache.redis.enabled`
//! can be overwritten by the environment variable `XENOS__CACHE__REDIS__ENABLED`.
//!
//! ## Layer 2 (Deployment configuration) \[optional\]
//!
//! The next layer is an optional configuration file intended to be used by deployments. The file
//! location can be configured using the `CONFIG_FILE` environment variable, defaulting to `config/config`.
//! The file can be any file type supported by [config] (e.g. `config/config.toml`).
//!
//! ## Layer 3 (Local configuration)  \[optional\]
//!
//! The next layer is an optional configuration file intended to be used for local testing. The file
//! is expected to be at `config/local` and can be any file type supported by [config] (e.g. `config/local.toml`).
//! This configuration file SHOULD NOT be published by git, as it could contain secrets (e.g. redis credentials).
//!
//! ## Layer 4 (Default configuration)
//!
//! The base layer is a configuration file confining the default configuration. The file is expected
//! to be at `config/default` and can be any file type supported by [config] (e.g. `config/default.toml`).
//! This file gives a default value for all settings fields. It is published by git and SHOULD NEVER
//! contain secrets.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The application configuration can be created by using [Settings::new]. This loads/overrides the
//! configuration fields layer-by-layer.
//!
//! ```rs
//! let settings: Settings = Settings::new()?;
//! ```

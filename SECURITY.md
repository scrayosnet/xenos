# Security Policy

We take the security of our projects very seriously. Therefore, we try to react to reports as fast as possible. However,
please allow us some time to implement the necessary changes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to **[security@scrayos-net](mailto:security@scrayos.net)** and do not
use the regular GitHub issues. You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will
release a patch as soon as possible, depending on the complexity and severity. If you do not hear from us, please follow
up to confirm, we received your original message.

Please include as much information as possible with your report. If you have steps to reproduce, that will greatly speed
up the fix.
